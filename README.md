# PCA_2

# An application of PCA (Principle Component Analysis)

Two datasets (Ex.1 grains dataset, 2-D) and (Ex. 2 fish dataset 6D) are considered.

In fitst example I have plotted the arrow (principle vector, basis in mathematical term) that indicates the direction of scatter plott.

In second example, I have taken fish dataset (6-D) and Make a plot of the variances of the PCA features to find out which dimension is 
important and which dimenssion can be neglected. In this example I have also standarised the data as features have strong variation.

# Following python modules are required.

1. pandas
2. matplotlib.pyplot
pearsonr from scipy.stats
3. PCA from sklearn.decomposition
4. StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing 
5. make_pipeline from sklearn.pipeline
